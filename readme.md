Introduction
------------
SOCLEAF is a different way of thinking, in terms of programming.

Many people lament the fact that computers aren't as smart as people, and often a "simple" problem for a human is a program-crashing bug for a program.

I looked at the reasons for this, and noted that we humans start out like this. We only know as much as we prepare ourselves for - what we forsee - and as such, anything that we don't quite understand or have knowledge for can also be a problem for us.

I think there are currently a few things that separate us from machines:

* We almost never do something the same way twice - it's our nature that we aren't exact enough to do this. But this is a blessing - in this we can, by accident or through experimentation, come up with a better or easier method of doing something. This leads to a continuous cycle of refinement that can't be done with programs.

* Whether we realise it or not, we have a vast array of possible solutions to many problems that we can attempt before we deduce that something is beyond our capabilities and that we can't proceed further. This is taught to us in general life lessons in a way that we rarely realise. One simply has to look at a baby unable to find the solution to pushing a square object into a square hole to see that life has taught us already a fundamental solution to this problem - rotate the object so that it fits. As children we learn this through experimentation, even it was an accident we came to the solution. Science is filled with many such "happy accidents" that lead to important scientific discoveries.

* We have others to ask to for help. This is a core theory to SOCLEAF, and goes hand in hand with:

* We rarely prepare for every single possible outcome. When you buy a car, or drive it for the first time, it is unlikely you know every inch of that car, what can go wrong, and what to do when it does. In this single way we can be likened to programs - we only know as much as we have forseen, guessed at, and prepared for. However, this is rarely a problem for us, as there is always a roadside-assistance service or mechanic we can call if things go really bad.

This brings me to the point of the introduction: Only once we realise how we differ, can we work towards something that brings us closer together.

The rest of this document will demonstrate real-world examples which closely resemble a typical programming problem, and how we can benefit from using the same approach a human would use to overcome issues.
